## FTC Code

This repository contains a decent portion of the work from FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) team 10237, US Robotics, of which I was a member of from 2015 to 2019 and a captain for the 2018-19 season. I have included our 2016-17 engineering journal (the Velocity Vortex season) and the 2018-19 engineering journal, both of which I wrote significant portions of. I have also included our submission sheet to the Control award, which is the programming and control systems award. Finally, I included our Relic Recovery (2017-18 season) code, of which I wrote all of in the `rr_src` folder.

While in FTC, our team was highly successful, qualifying for Ohio states all four years, winning Ohio states once, winning multiple awards for innovation, programming, design, and community outreach, and ranking 17th at the World Championship in 2018. In 2019 I was given the honor of competing on the team that won the World Championship, team 9971, as an honorary member.
